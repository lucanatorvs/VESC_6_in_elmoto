# parts list

## Elmoto hr1

This is the moped on witch the entire project is based, the only parts i used form the original are:

1. the frame and wheels (including the brakes).
2. the hub motor.
3. the battery (see below for elaboration).

### Battery

The battery can be sourced elsewhere, I recommend at least a 10s battery (but
this depends on the kind of motor you use) with at least about a kWh of
capacity, depending on your use case.

The battery that comes with the L motor is a 13S 14P I believe.

## ESC

The ESCS a VESC 6 MkV from
[trampaboards](https://trampaboards.com/1-x-vesc-6-mkv--170-tax-each-p-27529.html),
VESC is a open source project by [Benjamin
Vedder](https://github.com/vedderb/bldc-hardware). I chose this ESC Because
it's open source and powerful.  It's rating of 60V 100A comes down to a power
consumption of 6 kW. And since the maximum allowed power level in the
Netherlands is half that, the VESCS sufficiently powerful.

## Other components

I used some arduinos, perfboards, and a LCD display from
[grove](https://www.kiwi-electronics.nl/grove-lcd-rgb-backlight?search=lcd&description=true).
